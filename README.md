bladerunner
=================================

Bladerunner is a program to send and receive information from any type of ssh enabled text based device.
It can run through a jumpbox if there are networking restrictions. You can also provide an additional password 
to use for any program after logging in, such as MySQL or sudo. bladerunner will attempt to use the host password
for everything unless you specify otherwise, allowing it to default through sudo in simple use cases. MySQL, FTP, 
and telnet prompts are included as well as the default Ubuntu and CentOS bash shells and password prompts. You can 
provide an additional prompt via command line arguments. bladerunner will automatically accept SSH certificates and 
will throw ^C at any command that exceeds the timeout before returning. Commands can be loaded into a file and run 
from there line by line per host.
